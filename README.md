# mmgy-slider

[12db67d] started-build

Semantic HTML layout implemented.

I placed the the logo outside of the slider's content. It's not clear from the prototype does it belong to the content group or not, but my common sence says it should be an overlay.

Keep the title text in a Title Case and use CSS to capitalise it.

Navigation arrows are not included to the sources, copying them from Figma.

According to the mockups the popup is not really overlays the title state of the slide, but just being a different state to it. Also there is no way for the user to "close" it or come back to the title state. Implementing it as it whown on the mockups and will try to make my version later on.
